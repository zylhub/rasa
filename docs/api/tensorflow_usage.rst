TensorFlow Configuration
========================

TensorFlow allows configuring options in the runtime environment via
`TF Config submodule <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/config>`_. Rasa Open Source supports a smaller subset of these
configuration options and makes appropriate calls to the ``tf.config`` submodule.
This smaller subset comprises of configurations that developers frequently use with Rasa Open Source.
All configuration options are specified using environment variables as shown in subsequent sections.

Optimizing CPU Performance
--------------------------

Parallelizing One Operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set ``TF_INTRA_OP_PARALLELISM_THREADS`` as an environment variable to specify the maximum number of threads that can be used
to parallelize the execution of one operation. If left unspecified, this value defaults to ``0`` which means TensorFlow should
pick an appropriate value depending on the system configuration.

Parallelizing Multiple Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set ``TF_INTER_OP_PARALLELISM_THREADS`` as an environment variable to specify the maximum number of threads that can be used
to parallelize the execution of multiple **non-blocking** operations. If left unspecified, this value defaults to ``0``
which means TensorFlow should pick an appropriate value depending on the system configuration.

Optimizing GPU Performance
--------------------------

Limiting GPU Memory Growth
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TensorFlow by default blocks all the available GPU memory for the running process. This can be limiting if you are running
multiple TensorFlow processes and want to distribute memory across them. To prevent this,
set the environment variable ``TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH`` to ``True``.

Restricting Absolute GPU Memory Available
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Often, a developer wants to limit the absolute amount of GPU memory that can be used by a process.

For example, you may have two visible GPUs(``GPU:0`` and ``GPU:1``) and you want to allocate 1024 MB from the first GPU
and 2048 MB from the second GPU.
You can do so by setting an environment variable as ``TF_GPU_MEMORY_ALLOC="0:1024, 1:2048"``.

Another scenario can be where you have access to 2 GPUs(``GPU:0`` and ``GPU:1``) but you would like to use only the second
GPU.
``TF_GPU_MEMORY_ALLOC="1:2048"`` would make 2048 MB of memory available from GPU 1.
