:desc: Define intents, entities, slots and actions in Rasa to build contextual
       AI Assistants and chatbots using open source bot framework Rasa.

.. _domains:

Domains
=======

.. edit-link::

The ``Domain`` defines the universe in which your assistant operates.
It specifies the ``intents``, ``entities``, ``slots``, and ``actions``
your bot should know about. Optionally, it can also include ``responses``
for the things your bot can say.

.. contents::
   :local:


An example of a Domain
----------------------

As an example, the domain created by ``rasa init`` has the following yaml definition:


.. literalinclude:: ../../rasa/cli/initial_project/domain.yml
   :language: yaml

**What does this mean?**

Your NLU model will define the ``intents`` and ``entities`` that you
need to include in the domain. The ``entities`` section lists all entities
extracted by any :ref:`entity extractor<entity-extraction>` in your
NLU pipeline.

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

         entities:
            - PERSON          # entity extracted by SpacyEntityExtractor
            - time            # entity extracted by DucklingHTTPExtractor
            - membership_type # custom entity extracted by CRFEntityExtractor
            - priority        # custom entity extracted by CRFEntityExtractor


:ref:`slots` hold information you want to keep track of during a conversation.
A categorical slot called ``risk_level`` would be
defined like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

         slots:
            risk_level:
               type: categorical
               values:
               - low
               - medium
               - high


:ref:`Here <slot-classes>` you can find the full list of slot types defined by
Rasa Core, along with syntax for including them in your domain file.


:ref:`actions` are the things your bot can actually do.
For example, an action could:

* respond to a user,
* make an external API call,
* query a database, or
* just about anything!

Custom Actions and Slots
------------------------

To reference slots in your domain, you need to reference them by
their **module path**. To reference custom actions, use their **name**.
For example, if you have a module called ``my_actions`` containing
a class ``MyAwesomeAction``, and module ``my_slots`` containing
``MyAwesomeSlot``, you would add these lines to the domain file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   actions:
     - my_custom_action
     ...

   slots:
     - my_slots.MyAwesomeSlot


The ``name`` function of ``MyAwesomeAction`` needs to return
``my_custom_action`` in this example (for more details,
see :ref:`custom-actions`).

.. _domain-responses:

Responses
---------

Responses are messages the bot will send back to the user. There are
two ways to use these responses:

1. If the name of the response starts with ``utter_``, the response can
   directly be used as an action. You would add the response
   to the domain:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      responses:
        utter_greet:
        - text: "Hey! How are you?"

   Afterwards, you can use the response as an action in the
   stories:

   .. code-block:: story

      ## greet the user
      * intent_greet
        - utter_greet

   When ``utter_greet`` is run as an action, it will send the message from
   the response back to the user.

2. You can use the responses to generate response messages from your
   custom actions using the dispatcher:
   ``dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_greet")``.
   This allows you to separate the logic of generating
   the messages from the actual copy. In your custom action code, you can
   send a message based on the response like this:

   .. code-block:: python

      from rasa_sdk.actions import Action

      class ActionGreet(Action):
        def name(self):
            return 'action_greet'

        def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
            dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_greet")
            return []

Images and Buttons
------------------

Responses defined in a domain's yaml file can contain images and
buttons as well:

.. code-block:: yaml

   responses:
     utter_greet:
     - text: "Hey! How are you?"
       buttons:
       - title: "great"
         payload: "great"
       - title: "super sad"
         payload: "super sad"
     utter_cheer_up:
     - text: "Here is something to cheer you up:"
       image: "https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg"

.. note::

   Please keep in mind that it is up to the implementation of the output
   channel on how to display the defined buttons. The command line, for
   example, can't display buttons or images, but tries to mimic them by
   printing the options.

Custom Output Payloads
----------------------

You can also send any arbitrary output to the output channel using the
``custom:`` key. Note that since the domain is in yaml format, the json
payload should first be converted to yaml format.

For example, although date pickers are not a defined parameter in responses 
because they are not supported by most channels, a Slack date picker
can be sent like so:

.. code-block:: yaml

   responses:
     utter_take_bet:
     - custom:
         blocks:
         - type: section
           text:
             text: "Make a bet on when the world will end:"
             type: mrkdwn
           accessory:
             type: datepicker
             initial_date: '2019-05-21'
             placeholder:
               type: plain_text
               text: Select a date


Channel-Specific Responses
--------------------------

For each response, you can have multiple **response templates** (see :ref:`variations`).
If you have certain response templates that you would like sent only to specific
channels, you can specify this with the ``channel:`` key. The value should match
the name defined in the ``name()`` method of the channel's ``OutputChannel``
class. Channel-specific responses are especially useful if creating custom
output payloads that will only work in certain channels.


.. code-block:: yaml

  responses:
    utter_ask_game:
    - text: "Which game would you like to play?"
      channel: "slack"
      custom:
        - # payload for Slack dropdown menu to choose a game
    - text: "Which game would you like to play?"
      buttons:
      - title: "Chess"
        payload: '/inform{"game": "chess"}'
      - title: "Checkers"
        payload: '/inform{"game": "checkers"}'
      - title: "Fortnite"
        payload: '/inform{"game": "fortnite"}'

Each time your bot looks for responses, it will first check to see if there
are any channel-specific response templates for the connected channel. If there are, it
will choose **only** from these response templates. If no channel-specific response templates are
found, it will choose from any response templates that do not have a defined ``channel``.
Therefore, it is good practice to always have at least one response template for each
response that has no ``channel`` specified so that your bot can respond in all
environments, including in the shell and in interactive learning.

Variables
---------

You can also use **variables** in your responses to insert information
collected during the dialogue. You can either do that in your custom python
code or by using the automatic slot filling mechanism. For example, if you
have a response like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

  responses:
    utter_greet:
    - text: "Hey, {name}. How are you?"

Rasa will automatically fill that variable with a value found in a slot called
``name``.

In custom code, you can retrieve a response by using:

.. testsetup::

   from rasa_sdk.actions import Action

.. testcode::

   class ActionCustom(Action):
      def name(self):
         return "action_custom"

      def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
         # send utter default response to user
         dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_default")
         # ... other code
         return []

If the response contains variables denoted with ``{my_variable}``
you can supply values for the fields by passing them as keyword
arguments to ``utter_message``:

.. code-block:: python

  dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_greet", my_variable="my text")

.. _variations:

Variations
----------

If you want to randomly vary the response sent to the user, you can list
multiple **response templates** and Rasa will randomly pick one of them, e.g.:

.. code-block:: yaml

  responses:
    utter_greeting:
    - text: "Hey, {name}. How are you?"
    - text: "Hey, {name}. How is your day going?"

.. _use_entities:

Ignoring entities for certain intents
-------------------------------------

If you want all entities to be ignored for certain intents, you can
add the ``use_entities: []`` parameter to the intent in your domain
file like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

  intents:
    - greet:
        use_entities: []

To ignore some entities or explicitly take only certain entities
into account you can use this syntax:

.. code-block:: yaml

  intents:
  - greet:
      use_entities:
        - name
        - first_name
      ignore_entities:
        - location
        - age

This means that excluded entities for those intents will be unfeaturized and therefore
will not impact the next action predictions. This is useful when you have
an intent where you don't care about the entities being picked up. If you list
your intents as normal without this parameter, the entities will be
featurized as normal.

.. note::

    If you really want these entities not to influence action prediction we
    suggest you make the slots with the same name of type ``unfeaturized``.

.. _session_config:

Session configuration
---------------------

A conversation session represents the dialogue between the assistant and the user.
Conversation sessions can begin in three ways:

  1. the user begins the conversation with the assistant,
  2. the user sends their first message after a configurable period of inactivity, or
  3. a manual session start is triggered with the ``/session_start`` intent message.

You can define the period of inactivity after which a new conversation
session is triggered in the domain under the ``session_config`` key.
``session_expiration_time`` defines the time of inactivity in minutes after which a
new session will begin. ``carry_over_slots_to_new_session`` determines whether
existing set slots should be carried over to new sessions.

The default session configuration looks as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

  session_config:
    session_expiration_time: 60  # value in minutes, 0 means infinitely long
    carry_over_slots_to_new_session: true  # set to false to forget slots between sessions

This means that if a user sends their first message after 60 minutes of inactivity, a
new conversation session is triggered, and that any existing slots are carried over
into the new session. Setting the value of ``session_expiration_time`` to 0 means
that sessions will not end (note that the ``action_session_start`` action will still
be triggered at the very beginning of conversations).

.. note::

  A session start triggers the default action ``action_session_start``. Its default
  implementation moves all existing slots into the new session. Note that all
  conversations begin with an ``action_session_start``. Overriding this action could
  for instance be used to initialise the tracker with slots from an external API
  call, or to start the conversation with a bot message. The docs on
  :ref:`custom_session_start` shows you how to do that.
