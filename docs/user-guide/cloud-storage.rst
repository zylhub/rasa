Cloud Storage
=============

.. edit-link::

Rasa supports using `S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`_ ,
`GCS <https://cloud.google.com/storage/>`_ and `Azure Storage <https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/>`_ to save your models.

* Amazon S3 Storage
    S3 is supported using the ``boto3`` module which you can
    install with ``pip install boto3``.

    Start the Rasa server with ``remote-storage`` option set to
    ``aws``. Get your S3 credentials and set the following
    environment variables:

    - ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``
    - ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``
    - ``AWS_DEFAULT_REGION``
    - ``BUCKET_NAME``
    - ``AWS_ENDPOINT_URL``

    If there is no bucket with the name ``BUCKET_NAME``, Rasa will create it.

* Google Cloud Storage
    GCS is supported using the ``google-cloud-storage`` package,
    which you can install with ``pip install google-cloud-storage``.

    Start the Rasa server with ``remote-storage`` option set to ``gcs``.

    When running on google app engine and compute engine, the auth
    credentials are already set up. For running locally or elsewhere,
    checkout their
    `client repo <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/tree/master/storage/cloud-client#authentication>`_
    for details on setting up authentication. It involves creating
    a service account key file from google cloud console,
    and setting the ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` environment
    variable to the path of that key file.

* Azure Storage
    Azure is supported using the legacy ``azure-storage-blob`` package (v 2.1.0),
    which you can install with ``pip install -I azure-storage-blob==2.1.0``.

    Start the Rasa server with ``remote-storage`` option set to ``azure``.

    The following environment variables must be set:

    - ``AZURE_CONTAINER``
    - ``AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME``
    - ``AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY``

    If there is no container with the name ``AZURE_CONTAINER``, Rasa will create it.

Models are gzipped before they are saved in the cloud. The gzipped file naming convention
is `{MODEL_NAME}.tar.gz` and it is stored in the root folder of the storage service.
Currently, you are not able to manually specify the path on the cloud storage.

If storing trained models, Rasa will gzip the new model and upload it to the container. If retrieving/loading models
from the cloud storage, Rasa will download the gzipped model locally and extract the contents to a temporary directory.
