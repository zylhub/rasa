Rasa Change Log
===============

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to `Semantic Versioning`_ starting with version 1.0.

[Unreleased 1.4.0] - `master`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added
-----
- log a warning if the ``Interpreter`` picks up an intent or an entity that does not
  exist in the domain file.
- added ``DynamoTrackerStore`` to support persistence of agents running on AWS
- added docstrings for ``TrackerStore`` classes
- added buttons and images to mattermost.
- `CRFEntityExtractor` updated to accept arbitrary token-level features like word
  vectors (issues/4214)
- `SpacyFeaturizer` updated to add `ner_features` for `CRFEntityExtractor`
- Sanitizing incoming messages from slack to remove slack formatting like <mailto:xyz@rasa.com|xyz@rasa.com> 
  or <http://url.com|url.com> and substitute it with original content
- Added the ability to configure the number of Sanic worker processes in the HTTP
  server (``rasa.server``) and input channel server
  (``rasa.core.agent.handle_channels()``). The number of workers can be set using the
  environment variable ``SANIC_WORKERS`` (default: 1). A value of >1 is allowed only in
  combination with ``RedisLockStore`` as the lock store.

Changed
-------
- Unknown sections in markdown format (NLU data) are not ignored anymore, but instead an error is raised.
- It is now easier to add metadata to a ``UserMessage`` in existing channels.
  You can do so by overwriting the method ``get_metadata``. The return value of this
  method will be passed to the ``UserMessage`` object.
- Tests can now be run in parallel
- Serialise ``DialogueStateTracker`` as json instead of pickle. **DEPRECATION warning**:
  Deserialisation of pickled trackers will be deprecated in version 2.0. For now,
  trackers are still loaded from pickle but will be dumped as json in any subsequent
  save operations.

Removed
-------
- Removed Python 3.5 support

Fixed
-----
- fixed missing ``tkinter`` dependency for running tests on Ubuntu
- fixed issue with ``conversation`` JSON serialization
- fixed the hanging HTTP call with ``ner_duckling_http`` pipeline
- fixed Interactive Learning intent payload messages saving in nlu files

[Unreleased 1.3.9]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added
-----

Fixed
-----
- Fixed ``argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable`` when using ``rasa shell``,
  ``rasa interactive`` / ``rasa run``

Changed
-------

Removed
-------


[1.3.8] - 2019-10-08
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changed
-------
- Policies now only get imported if they are actually used. This removes
  TensorFlow warnings when starting Rasa X

Fixed
-----
- Fixed error ``Object of type 'MaxHistoryTrackerFeaturizer' is not JSON serializable``
  when running ``rasa train core``
- Default channel ``send_`` methods no longer support kwargs as they caused issues in incompatible channels

[1.3.7] - 2019-09-27
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed
-----
- re-added TLS, SRV dependencies for PyMongo
- socketio can now be run without turning on the ``--enable-api`` flag
- MappingPolicy no longer fails when the latest action doesn't have a policy

[1.3.6] - 2019-09-21
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added
-----
- Added the ability for users to specify a conversation id to send a message to when
  using the ``RasaChat`` input channel.

[1.3.5] - 2019-09-20
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed
-----
- Fixed issue where ``rasa init`` would fail without spaCy being installed

[1.3.4] - 2019-09-20
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added
-----
- Added the ability to set the ``backlog`` parameter in Sanics ``run()`` method using
  the ``SANIC_BACKLOG`` environment variable. This parameter sets the
  number of unaccepted connections the server allows before refusing new
  connections. A default value of 100 is used if the variable is not set.
- Status endpoint (``/status``) now also returns the number of training processes currently running

Fixed
-----
- Added the ability to properly deal with spaCy ``Doc``-objects created on
  empty strings as discussed `here <https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/issues/4445>`_.
  Only training samples that actually bear content are sent to ``self.nlp.pipe``
  for every given attribute. Non-content-bearing samples are converted to empty
  ``Doc``-objects. The resulting lists are merged with their preserved order and
  properly returned.
- asyncio warnings are now only printed if the callback takes more than 100ms
  (up from 1ms)
- ``agent.load_model_from_server`` no longer affects logging

Changed
-------
- The endpoint ``POST /model/train`` no longer supports specifying an output directory
  for the trained model using the field ``out``. Instead you can choose whether you
  want to save the trained model in the default model directory (``models``)
  (default behavior) or in a temporary directory by specifying the
  ``save_to_default_model_directory`` field in the training request.

[1.3.3] - 2019-09-13
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed
-----
- Added a check to avoid training ``CountVectorizer`` for a particular
  attribute of a message if no text is provided for that attribute across
  the training data.
- Default one-hot representation for label featurization inside ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier`` if label features don't exist.
- Policy ensemble no longer incorrectly wrings "missing mapping policy" when
  mapping policy is present.
- "test" from ``utter_custom_json`` now correctly saved to tracker when using telegram channel

Removed
-------
- Removed computation of ``intent_spacy_doc``. As a result, none of the spacy components process intents now.

[1.3.2] - 2019-09-10
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed
-----
- SQL tracker events are retrieved ordered by timestamps. This fixes interactive
  learning events being shown in the wrong order.

[1.3.1] - 2019-09-09
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changed
-------
- Pin gast to == 0.2.2


[1.3.0] - 2019-09-05
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added
-----
- Added option to persist nlu training data (default: False)
- option to save stories in e2e format for interactive learning
- bot messages contain the ``timestamp`` of the ``BotUttered`` event, which can be used in channels
- ``FallbackPolicy`` can now be configured to trigger when the difference between confidences of two predicted intents is too narrow
- experimental training data importer which supports training with data of multiple
  sub bots. Please see the
  `docs <https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/api/training-data-importers/>`_ for more
  information.
- throw error during training when triggers are defined in the domain without
  ``MappingPolicy`` being present in the policy ensemble
- The tracker is now available within the interpreter's ``parse`` method, giving the
  ability to create interpreter classes that use the tracker state (eg. slot values)
  during the parsing of the message. More details on motivation of this change see
  issues/3015.
- add example bot ``knowledgebasebot`` to showcase the usage of ``ActionQueryKnowledgeBase``
- ``softmax`` starspace loss for both ``EmbeddingPolicy`` and ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier``
- ``balanced`` batching strategy for both ``EmbeddingPolicy`` and ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier``
- ``max_history`` parameter for ``EmbeddingPolicy``
- Successful predictions of the NER are written to a file if ``--successes`` is set when running ``rasa test nlu``
- Incorrect predictions of the NER are written to a file by default. You can disable it via ``--no-errors``.
- New NLU component ``ResponseSelector`` added for the task of response selection
- Message data attribute can contain two more keys - ``response_key``, ``response`` depending on the training data
- New action type implemented by ``ActionRetrieveResponse`` class and identified with ``response_`` prefix
- Vocabulary sharing inside ``CountVectorsFeaturizer`` with ``use_shared_vocab`` flag. If set to True, vocabulary of corpus is shared between text, intent and response attributes of message
- Added an option to share the hidden layer weights of text input and label input inside ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier`` using the flag ``share_hidden_layers``
- New type of training data file in NLU which stores response phrases for response selection task.
- Add flag ``intent_split_symbol`` and ``intent_tokenization_flag`` to all ``WhitespaceTokenizer``, ``JiebaTokenizer`` and ``SpacyTokenizer``
- Added evaluation for response selector. Creates a report ``response_selection_report.json`` inside ``--out`` directory.
- argument ``--config-endpoint`` to specify the URL from which ``rasa x`` pulls
  the runtime configuration (endpoints and credentials)
- ``LockStore`` class storing instances of ``TicketLock`` for every ``conversation_id``
- environment variables ``SQL_POOL_SIZE`` (default: 50) and ``SQL_MAX_OVERFLOW``
  (default: 100) can be set to control the pool size and maximum pool overflow for
  ``SQLTrackerStore`` when used with the ``postgresql`` dialect
- Add a `bot_challenge` intent and a `utter_iamabot` action to all example projects and the rasa init bot.
- Allow sending attachments when using the socketio channel
- ``rasa data validate`` will fail with a non-zero exit code if validation fails

Changed
-------
- added character-level ``CountVectorsFeaturizer`` with empirically found parameters
  into the ``supervised_embeddings`` NLU pipeline template
- NLU evaluations now also stores its output in the output directory like the core evaluation
- show warning in case a default path is used instead of a provided, invalid path
- compare mode of ``rasa train core`` allows the whole core config comparison,
  naming style of models trained for comparison is changed (this is a breaking change)
- pika keeps a single connection open, instead of open and closing on each incoming event
- ``RasaChatInput`` fetches the public key from the Rasa X API. The key is used to
  decode the bearer token containing the conversation ID. This requires
  ``rasa-x>=0.20.2``.
- more specific exception message when loading custom components depending on whether component's path or
  class name is invalid or can't be found in the global namespace
- change priorities so that the ``MemoizationPolicy`` has higher priority than the ``MappingPolicy``
- substitute LSTM with Transformer in ``EmbeddingPolicy``
- ``EmbeddingPolicy`` can now use ``MaxHistoryTrackerFeaturizer``
- non zero ``evaluate_on_num_examples`` in ``EmbeddingPolicy``
  and ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier`` is the size of
  hold out validation set that is excluded from training data
- defaults parameters and architectures for both ``EmbeddingPolicy`` and
  ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier`` are changed (this is a breaking change)
- evaluation of NER does not include 'no-entity' anymore
- ``--successes`` for ``rasa test nlu`` is now boolean values. If set incorrect/successful predictions
  are saved in a file.
- ``--errors`` is renamed to ``--no-errors`` and is now a boolean value. By default incorrect predictions are saved
  in a file. If ``--no-errors`` is set predictions are not written to a file.
- Remove ``label_tokenization_flag`` and ``label_split_symbol`` from ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier``. Instead move these parameters to ``Tokenizers``.
- Process features of all attributes of a message, i.e. - text, intent and response inside the respective component itself. For e.g. - intent of a message is now tokenized inside the tokenizer itself.
- Deprecate ``as_markdown`` and ``as_json`` in favour of ``nlu_as_markdown`` and ``nlu_as_json`` respectively.
- pin python-engineio >= 3.9.3
- update python-socketio req to >= 4.3.1

Fixed
-----
- ``rasa test nlu`` with a folder of configuration files
- ``MappingPolicy`` standard featurizer is set to ``None``
- Removed ``text`` parameter from send_attachment function in slack.py to avoid duplication of text output to slackbot
- server ``/status`` endpoint reports status when an NLU-only model is loaded

Removed
-------
- Removed ``--report`` argument from ``rasa test nlu``. All output files are stored in the ``--out`` directory.

  in a parallel process, which prevents the currently loaded model unloading
- added missing implementation of the ``keys()`` function for the Redis Tracker
  Store
- in interactive learning: only updates entity values if user changes annotation
- log options from the command line interface are applied (they overwrite the environment variable)
- all message arguments (kwargs in dispatcher.utter methods, as well as template args) are now sent through to output channels
