[1.8.0] - 2020-02-26
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
- `#4991 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4991>`_: Removed ``Agent.continue_training`` and the ``dump_flattened_stories`` parameter
  from ``Agent.persist``.
- `#5266 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5266>`_: Properties ``Component.provides`` and ``Component.requires`` are deprecated.
  Use ``Component.required_components()`` instead.

Features
--------
- `#2674 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/2674>`_: Add default value ``__other__`` to ``values`` of a ``CategoricalSlot``. 

  All values not mentioned in the list of values of a ``CategoricalSlot``
  will be mapped to ``__other__`` for featurization.
- `#4088 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4088>`_: Add story structure validation functionality (e.g. `rasa data validate stories --max-history 5`).
- `#5065 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5065>`_: Add :ref:`LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer` to sparse featurizers.

  ``LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer`` does the same featurization as the ``CRFEntityExtractor``. We extracted the
  featurization into a separate component so that the features can be reused and featurization is independent from the
  entity extraction.
- `#5187 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5187>`_: Integrate language models from HuggingFace's `Transformers <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`_ Library.

  Add a new NLP component :ref:`HFTransformersNLP` which tokenizes and featurizes incoming messages using a specified
  pre-trained model with the Transformers library as the backend.
  Add :ref:`LanguageModelTokenizer` and :ref:`LanguageModelFeaturizer` which use the information from
  :ref:`HFTransformersNLP` and sets them correctly for message object.
  Language models currently supported: BERT, OpenAIGPT, GPT-2, XLNet, DistilBert, RoBERTa.
- `#5225 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5225>`_: Added a new CLI command ``rasa export`` to publish tracker events from a persistent
  tracker store using an event broker. See :ref:`section_export`, :ref:`tracker-stores`
  and :ref:`event-brokers` for more details.
- `#5230 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5230>`_: Refactor how GPU and CPU environments are configured for TensorFlow 2.0.

  Please refer to the :ref:`documentation <tensorflow_usage>` to understand
  which environment variables to set in what scenarios. A couple of examples are shown below as well:

  .. code-block:: python

      # This specifies to use 1024 MB of memory from GPU with logical ID 0 and 2048 MB of memory from GPU with logical ID 1
      TF_GPU_MEMORY_ALLOC="0:1024, 1:2048"

      # Specifies that at most 3 CPU threads can be used to parallelize multiple non-blocking operations
      TF_INTER_OP_PARALLELISM_THREADS="3"

      # Specifies that at most 2 CPU threads can be used to parallelize a particular operation.
      TF_INTRA_OP_PARALLELISM_THREADS="2"

- `#5266 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5266>`_: Added a new NLU component :ref:`DIETClassifier <diet-classifier>` and a new policy :ref:`TEDPolicy <ted_policy>`.

  DIET (Dual Intent and Entity Transformer) is a multi-task architecture for intent classification and entity
  recognition. You can read more about this component in our :ref:`documentation <diet-classifier>`.
  The new component will replace the :ref:`EmbeddingIntentClassifier <embedding-intent-classifier>` and the
  :ref:`CRFEntityExtractor` in the future.
  Those two components are deprecated from now on.
  See :ref:`migration guide <migration-to-rasa-1.8>` for details on how to
  switch to the new component.

  :ref:`TEDPolicy <ted_policy>` is the new name for :ref:`EmbeddingPolicy <embedding_policy>`.
  ``EmbeddingPolicy`` is deprecated from now on.
  The functionality of ``TEDPolicy`` and ``EmbeddingPolicy`` is the same.
  Please update your configuration file to use the new name for the policy.
- `#663 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/663>`_: The sentence vector of the ``SpacyFeaturizer`` and ``MitieFeaturizer`` can be calculated using max or mean pooling.

  To specify the pooling operation, set the option ``pooling`` for the ``SpacyFeaturizer`` or the ``MitieFeaturizer``
  in your configuration file. The default pooling operation is ``mean``. The mean pooling operation also does not take
  into account words, that do not have a word vector.
  See our :ref:`documentation <components>` for more details.

Improvements
------------
- `#3975 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/3975>`_: Added command line argument ``--conversation-id`` to ``rasa interactive``.
  If the argument is not given, ``conversation_id`` defaults to a random uuid.
- `#4653 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4653>`_: Added a new command-line argument ``--init-dir`` to command ``rasa init`` to specify
  the directory in which the project is initialised.
- `#4682 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4682>`_: Added support to send images with the twilio output channel.
- `#4817 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4817>`_: Part of Slack sanitization: 
  Multiple garbled URL's in a string coming from slack will be converted into actual strings.
  ``Example: health check of <http://eemdb.net|eemdb.net> and <http://eemdb1.net|eemdb1.net> to health check of
  eemdb.net and eemdb1.net``
- `#5117 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5117>`_: New command-line argument --conversation-id will be added and wiil give the ability to
  set specific conversation ID for each shell session, if not passed will be random.
- `#5211 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5211>`_: Messages sent to the :ref:`event-brokers-pika` are now persisted. This guarantees
  the RabbitMQ will re-send previously received messages after a crash. Note that this
  does not help for the case where messages are sent to an unavailable RabbitMQ instance.
- `#5250 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5250>`_: Added support for mattermost connector to use bot accounts.
- `#5266 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5266>`_: We updated our code to TensorFlow 2.
- `#5317 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5317>`_: Events exported using ``rasa export`` receive a message header if published through a
  ``PikaEventBroker``. The header is added to the message's ``BasicProperties.headers``
  under the ``rasa-export-process-id`` key
  (``rasa.core.constants.RASA_EXPORT_PROCESS_ID_HEADER_NAME``). The value is a
  UUID4 generated at each call of ``rasa export``. The resulting header is a key-value
  pair that looks as follows:

  .. code-block:: text

    'rasa-export-process-id': 'd3b3d3ffe2bd4f379ccf21214ccfb261'

- `#5292 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5292>`_: Added ``followlinks=True`` to os.walk calls, to allow the use of symlinks in training, NLU and domain data.
- `#4811 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4811>`_: Support invoking a ``SlackBot`` by direct messaging or ``@<app name>`` mentions.

Bugfixes
--------
- `#4006 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4006>`_: Fixed timestamp parsing warning when using DucklingHTTPExtractor
- `#4601 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4601>`_: Fixed issue with ``action_restart`` getting overridden by ``action_listen`` when the ``MappingPolicy`` and the
  `TwoStageFallbackPolicy <https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/policies/#two-stage-fallback-policy>`_ are used together.
- `#5201 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5201>`_: Fixed incorrectly raised Error encountered in pipelines with a ``ResponseSelector`` and NLG.

  When NLU training data is split before NLU pipeline comparison, 
  NLG responses were not also persisted and therefore training for a pipeline including the ``ResponseSelector`` would fail.

  NLG responses are now persisted along with NLU data to a ``/train`` directory in the ``run_x/xx%_exclusion`` folder.
- `#5277 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5277>`_: Fixed sending custom json with Twilio channel

Improved Documentation
----------------------
- `#5174 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5174>`_: Updated the documentation to properly suggest not to explicitly add utterance actions to the domain.
- `#5189 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5189>`_: Added user guide for reminders and external events, including ``reminderbot`` demo.

Miscellaneous internal changes
------------------------------
- #3923, #4597, #4903, #5180, #5189, #5266, #699


[1.7.4] - 2020-02-24
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bugfixes
--------
- `#5068 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5068>`_: Tracker stores supporting conversation sessions (``SQLTrackerStore`` and
  ``MongoTrackerStore``) do not save the tracker state to database immediately after
  starting a new conversation session. This leads to the number of events being saved
  in addition to the already-existing ones to be calculated correctly.

  This fixes ``action_listen`` events being saved twice at the beginning of
  conversation sessions.


[1.7.3] - 2020-02-21
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bugfixes
--------
- `#5231 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5231>`_: Fix segmentation fault when running ``rasa train`` or ``rasa shell``.

Improved Documentation
----------------------
- `#5286 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5286>`_: Fix doc links on "Deploying your Assistant" page


[1.7.2] - 2020-02-13
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bugfixes
--------
- `#5197 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5197>`_: Fixed incompatibility of Oracle with the :ref:`sql-tracker-store`, by using a ``Sequence``
  for the primary key columns. This does not change anything for SQL databases other than Oracle.
  If you are using Oracle, please create a sequence with the instructions in the :ref:`sql-tracker-store` docs.

Improved Documentation
----------------------
- `#5197 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5197>`_: Added section on setting up the SQLTrackerStore with Oracle
- `#5210 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5210>`_: Renamed "Running the Server" page to "Configuring the HTTP API"


[1.7.1] - 2020-02-11
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bugfixes
--------
- `#5106 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5106>`_: Fixed file loading of non proper UTF-8 story files, failing properly when checking for
  story files.
- `#5162 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5162>`_: Fix problem with multi-intents.
  Training with multi-intents using the ``CountVectorsFeaturizer`` together with ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier`` is
  working again.
- `#5171 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5171>`_: Fix bug ``ValueError: Cannot concatenate sparse features as sequence dimension does not match``.

  When training a Rasa model that contains responses for just some of the intents, training was failing.
  Fixed the featurizers to return a consistent feature vector in case no response was given for a specific message.
- `#5199 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5199>`_: If no text features are present in ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier`` return the intent ``None``.
- `#5216 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5216>`_: Resolve version conflicts: Pin version of cloudpickle to ~=1.2.0.


[1.7.0] - 2020-01-29
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
- `#4964 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4964>`_: The endpoint ``/conversations/<conversation_id>/execute`` is now deprecated. Instead, users should use
  the ``/conversations/<conversation_id>/trigger_intent`` endpoint and thus trigger intents instead of actions.
- `#4978 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4978>`_: Remove option ``use_cls_token`` from tokenizers and option ``return_sequence`` from featurizers.

  By default all tokenizer add a special token (``__CLS__``) to the end of the list of tokens.
  This token will be used to capture the features of the whole utterance.

  The featurizers will return a matrix of size (number-of-tokens x feature-dimension) by default.
  This allows to train sequence models.
  However, the feature vector of the ``__CLS__`` token can be used to train non-sequence models.
  The corresponding classifier can decide what kind of features to use.

Features
--------
- `#400 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/400>`_: Rename ``templates`` key in domain to ``responses``.

  ``templates`` key will still work for backwards compatibility but will raise a future warning.
- `#4902 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4902>`_: Added a new configuration parameter, ``ranking_length`` to the ``EmbeddingPolicy``, ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier``,
  and ``ResponseSelector`` classes.
- `#4964 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4964>`_: External events and reminders now trigger intents (and entities) instead of actions.

  Add new endpoint ``/conversations/<conversation_id>/trigger_intent``, which lets the user specify an intent and a
  list of entities that is injected into the conversation in place of a user message. The bot then predicts and
  executes a response action.
- `#4978 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4978>`_: Add ``ConveRTTokenizer``.

  The tokenizer should be used whenever the ``ConveRTFeaturizer`` is used.

  Every tokenizer now supports the following configuration options:
  ``intent_tokenization_flag``: Flag to check whether to split intents (default ``False``).
  ``intent_split_symbol``: Symbol on which intent should be split (default ``_``)

Improvements
------------
- `#1988 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/1988>`_: Remove the need of specifying utter actions in the ``actions`` section explicitly if these actions are already
  listed in the ``templates`` section.
- `#4877 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4877>`_: Entity examples that have been extracted using an external extractor are excluded
  from Markdown dumping in ``MarkdownWriter.dumps()``. The excluded external extractors
  are ``DucklingHTTPExtractor`` and ``SpacyEntityExtractor``.
- `#4902 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4902>`_: The ``EmbeddingPolicy``, ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier``, and ``ResponseSelector`` now by default normalize confidence
  levels over the top 10 results. See :ref:`migration-to-rasa-1.7` for more details.
- `#4964 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4964>`_: ``ReminderCancelled`` can now cancel multiple reminders if no name is given. It still cancels a single
  reminder if the reminder's name is specified.

Bugfixes
--------
- `#4774 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4774>`_: Requests to ``/model/train`` do not longer block other requests to the Rasa server.
- `#4896 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4896>`_: Fixed default behavior of ``rasa test core --evaluate-model-directory`` when called without ``--model``. Previously, the latest model file was used as ``--model``. Now the default model directory is used instead.

  New behavior of ``rasa test core --evaluate-model-directory`` when given an existing file as argument for ``--model``: Previously, this led to an error. Now a warning is displayed and the directory containing the given file is used as ``--model``.
- `#5040 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5040>`_: Updated the dependency ``networkx`` from 2.3.0 to 2.4.0. The old version created incompatibilities when using pip.

  There is an imcompatibility between Rasa dependecy requests 2.22.0 and the own depedency from Rasa for networkx raising errors upon pip install. There is also a bug corrected in ``requirements.txt`` which used ``~=`` instead of ``==``. All of these are fixed using networkx 2.4.0.
- `#5057 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5057>`_: Fixed compatibility issue with Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator if ``service_url`` lacked a trailing ``/``.
- `#5092 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5092>`_: DynamoDB tracker store decimal values will now be rounded on save. Previously values exceeding 38 digits caused an unhandled error.

Miscellaneous internal changes
------------------------------
- #4458, #4664, #4780, #5029


[1.6.2] - 2020-01-28
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Improvements
------------
- `#4994 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4994>`_: Switching back to a TensorFlow release which only includes CPU support to reduce the
  size of the dependencies. If you want to use the TensorFlow package with GPU support,
  please run ``pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.15.0``.

Bugfixes
--------
- `#5111 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5111>`_: Fixes ``Exception 'Loop' object has no attribute '_ready'`` error when running
  ``rasa init``.
- `#5126 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5126>`_: Updated the end-to-end ValueError you recieve when you have a invalid story format to point
  to the updated doc link.


[1.6.1] - 2020-01-07
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bugfixes
--------
- `#4989 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4989>`_: Use an empty domain in case a model is loaded which has no domain
  (avoids errors when accessing ``agent.doman.<some attribute>``).
- `#4995 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4995>`_: Replace error message with warning in tokenizers and featurizers if default parameter not set.
- `#5019 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5019>`_: Pin sanic patch version instead of minor version. Fixes sanic ``_run_request_middleware()`` error.
- `#5032 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5032>`_: Fix wrong calculation of additional conversation events when saving the conversation.
  This led to conversation events not being saved.
- `#5032 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/5032>`_: Fix wrong order of conversation events when pushing events to conversations via
  ``POST /conversations/<conversation_id>/tracker/events``.


[1.6.0] - 2019-12-18
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
- `#4935 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4935>`_: Removed ``ner_features`` as a feature name from ``CRFEntityExtractor``, use ``text_dense_features`` instead.

  The following settings match the previous ``NGramFeaturizer``:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      - name: 'CountVectorsFeaturizer'
          analyzer: 'char_wb'
          min_ngram: 3
          max_ngram: 17
          max_features: 10
          min_df: 5
- `#4957 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4957>`_: To use custom features in the ``CRFEntityExtractor`` use ``text_dense_features`` instead of ``ner_features``. If
  ``text_dense_features`` are present in the feature set, the ``CRFEntityExtractor`` will automatically make use of
  them. Just make sure to add a dense featurizer in front of the ``CRFEntityExtractor`` in your pipeline and set the
  flag ``return_sequence`` to ``True`` for that featurizer.
  See https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu/entity-extraction/#passing-custom-features-to-crfentityextractor.
- `#4990 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4990>`_: Deprecated ``Agent.continue_training``. Instead, a model should be retrained.
- `#684 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/684>`_: Specifying lookup tables directly in the NLU file is now deprecated. Please specify
  them in an external file.

Features
--------
- `#4795 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4795>`_: Replaced the warnings about missing templates, intents etc. in validator.py by debug messages.
- `#4830 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4830>`_: Added conversation sessions to trackers.

  A conversation session represents the dialog between the assistant and a user.
  Conversation sessions can begin in three ways: 1. the user begins the conversation
  with the assistant, 2. the user sends their first message after a configurable period
  of inactivity, or 3. a manual session start is triggered with the ``/session_start``
  intent message. The period of inactivity after which a new conversation session is
  triggered is defined in the domain using the ``session_expiration_time`` key in the
  ``session_config`` section. The introduction of conversation sessions comprises the
  following changes:

  - Added a new event ``SessionStarted`` that marks the beginning of a new conversation
    session.
  - Added a new default action ``ActionSessionStart``. This action takes all
    ``SlotSet`` events from the previous session and applies it to the next session.
  - Added a new default intent ``session_start`` which triggers the start of a new
    conversation session.
  - ``SQLTrackerStore`` and ``MongoTrackerStore`` only retrieve
    events from the last session from the database.


  .. note::

    The session behaviour is disabled for existing projects, i.e. existing domains
    without session config section.
- `#4935 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4935>`_: Preparation for an upcoming change in the ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier``:

  Add option ``use_cls_token`` to all tokenizers. If it is set to ``True``, the token ``__CLS__`` will be added to
  the end of the list of tokens. Default is set to ``False``. No need to change the default value for now.

  Add option ``return_sequence`` to all featurizers. By default all featurizers return a matrix of size
  (1 x feature-dimension). If the option ``return_sequence`` is set to ``True``, the corresponding featurizer will return
  a matrix of size (token-length x feature-dimension). See https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu/components/#featurizers.
  Default value is set to ``False``. However, you might want to set it to ``True`` if you want to use custom features
  in the ``CRFEntityExtractor``.
  See https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu/entity-extraction/#passing-custom-features-to-crfentityextractor.

  Changed some featurizers to use sparse features, which should reduce memory usage with large amounts of training data significantly.
  Read more: :ref:`text-featurizers` .

  .. warning::

      These changes break model compatibility. You will need to retrain your old models!

Improvements
------------
- `#3549 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/3549>`_: Added ``--no-plot`` option for ``rasa test`` command, which disables rendering of confusion matrix and histogram. By default plots will be rendered.
- `#4086 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4086>`_: If matplotlib couldn't set up a default backend, it will be set automatically to TkAgg/Agg one
- `#4647 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4647>`_: Add the option ```random_seed``` to the ```rasa data split nlu``` command to generate
  reproducible train/test splits.
- `#4734 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4734>`_: Changed ``url`` ``__init__()`` arguments for custom tracker stores to ``host`` to reflect the ``__init__`` arguments of
  currently supported tracker stores. Note that in ``endpoints.yml``, these are still declared as ``url``.
- `#4751 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4751>`_: The ``kafka-python`` dependency has become as an "extra" dependency. To use the
  ``KafkaEventConsumer``, ``rasa`` has to be installed with the ``[kafka]`` option, i.e.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install rasa[kafka]
- `#4801 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4801>`_: Allow creation of natural language interpreter and generator by classname reference
  in ``endpoints.yml``.
- `#4834 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4834>`_: Made it explicit that interactive learning does not work with NLU-only models.

  Interactive learning no longer trains NLU-only models if no model is provided
  and no core data is provided.
- `#4899 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4899>`_: The ``intent_report.json`` created by ``rasa test`` now creates an extra field
  ``confused_with`` for each intent. This is a dictionary containing the names of
  the most common false positives when this intent should be predicted, and the
  number of such false positives.
- `#4976 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4976>`_: ``rasa test nlu --cross-validation`` now also includes an evaluation of the response selector.
  As a result, the train and test F1-score, accuracy and precision is logged for the response selector.
  A report is also generated in the ``results`` folder by the name ``response_selection_report.json``

Bugfixes
--------
- `#4635 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4635>`_: If a ``wait_time_between_pulls`` is configured for the model server in ``endpoints.yml``,
  this will be used instead of the default one when running Rasa X.
- `#4759 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4759>`_: Training Luis data with ``luis_schema_version`` higher than 4.x.x will show a warning instead of throwing an exception.
- `#4799 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4799>`_: Running ``rasa interactive`` with no NLU data now works, with the functionality of ``rasa interactive core``.
- `#4917 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4917>`_: When loading models from S3, namespaces (folders within a bucket) are now respected.
  Previously, this would result in an error upon loading the model.
- `#4925 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4925>`_: "rasa init" will ask if user wants to train a model
- `#4942 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4942>`_: Pin ``multidict`` dependency to 4.6.1 to prevent sanic from breaking,
  see https://github.com/huge-success/sanic/issues/1729
- `#4985 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4985>`_: Fix errors during training and testing of ``ResponseSelector``.


[1.5.3] - 2019-12-11
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Improvements
------------
- `#4933 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4933>`_: Improved error message that appears when an incorrect parameter is passed to a policy.

Bugfixes
--------
- `#4914 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4914>`_: Added ``rasa/nlu/schemas/config.yml`` to wheel package
- `#4942 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4942>`_: Pin ``multidict`` dependency to 4.6.1 to prevent sanic from breaking,
  see https://github.com/huge-success/sanic/issues/1729


[1.5.2] - 2019-12-09
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Improvements
------------
- `#3684 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/3684>`_: ``rasa interactive`` will skip the story visualization of training stories in case
  there are more than 200 stories. Stories created during interactive learning will be
  visualized as before.
- `#4792 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4792>`_: The log level for SocketIO loggers, including ``websockets.protocol``, ``engineio.server``,
  and ``socketio.server``, is now handled by the ``LOG_LEVEL_LIBRARIES`` environment variable,
  where the default log level is ``ERROR``.
- `#4873 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4873>`_: Updated all example bots and documentation to use the updated ``dispatcher.utter_message()`` method from `rasa-sdk==1.5.0`.

Bugfixes
--------
- `#3684 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/3684>`_: ``rasa interactive`` will not load training stories in case the visualization is
  skipped.
- `#4789 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4789>`_: Fixed error where spacy models where not found in the docker images.
- `#4802 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4802>`_: Fixed unnecessary ``kwargs`` unpacking in ``rasa.test.test_core`` call in ``rasa.test.test`` function.
- `#4898 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4898>`_: Training data files now get loaded in the same order (especially relevant to subdirectories) each time to ensure training consistency when using a random seed.
- `#4918 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4918>`_: Locks for tickets in ``LockStore`` are immediately issued without a redundant
  check for their availability.

Improved Documentation
----------------------
- `#4844 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4844>`_: Added ``towncrier`` to automatically collect changelog entries.
- `#4869 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4869>`_: Document the pipeline for ``pretrained_embeddings_convert`` in the pre-configured pipelines section.
- `#4894 <https://github.com/rasahq/rasa/issues/4894>`_: ``Proactively Reaching Out to the User Using Actions`` now correctly links to the
  endpoint specification.

- Fixed format guessing for e2e stories with intent restated as ``/intent``

[1.4.4] - 2019-11-13
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Features
--------
- ``PikaEventProducer`` adds the RabbitMQ ``App ID`` message property to published
  messages with the value of the ``RASA_ENVIRONMENT`` environment variable. The
  message property will not be assigned if this environment variable isn't set.

Improvements
------------

[1.4.1] - 2019-10-22
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Regression: changes from ``1.2.12`` were missing from ``1.4.0``, readded them

[1.4.0] - 2019-10-19
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Features
--------
- add flag to CLI to persist NLU training data if needed
- log a warning if the ``Interpreter`` picks up an intent or an entity that does not
  exist in the domain file.
- added ``DynamoTrackerStore`` to support persistence of agents running on AWS
- added docstrings for ``TrackerStore`` classes

- Added the ability to configure the number of Sanic worker processes in the HTTP
  server (``rasa.server``) and input channel server
  (``rasa.core.agent.handle_channels()``). The number of workers can be set using the
  environment variable ``SANIC_WORKERS`` (default: 1). A value of >1 is allowed only in
  combination with ``RedisLockStore`` as the lock store.
- Botframework channel can handle uploaded files in ``UserMessage`` metadata.
- Added data validator that checks there is no duplicated example data across multiples intents

Improvements
------------
- Unknown sections in markdown format (NLU data) are not ignored anymore, but instead an error is raised.

  You can do so by overwriting the method ``get_metadata``. The return value of this
  method will be passed to the ``UserMessage`` object.
- Tests can now be run in parallel
- Serialise ``DialogueStateTracker`` as json instead of pickle. **DEPRECATION warning**:
  Deserialisation of pickled trackers will be deprecated in version 2.0. For now,
  trackers are still loaded from pickle but will be dumped as json in any subsequent
  save operations.
- Event brokers are now also passed to custom tracker stores (using the ``event_broker`` parameter)
- Don't run the Rasa Docker image as ``root``.
- Use multi-stage builds to reduce the size of the Rasa Docker image.

  ``rasa run actions`` command.

Bugfixes
--------
- Fixed visualization of stories with entities which led to a failing
  visualization in Rasa X

[1.3.9] - 2019-10-10
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  --ssl-ca-file flag).

Bugfixes
--------
- Fixed the hanging HTTP call with ``ner_duckling_http`` pipeline.
- Fixed text processing of ``intent`` attribute inside ``CountVectorFeaturizer``.
- Fixed ``argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable`` when using ``rasa shell``,
  ``rasa interactive`` / ``rasa run``

[1.3.8] - 2019-10-08
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Improvements
------------

  TensorFlow warnings when starting Rasa X

Bugfixes
--------
- Fixed error ``Object of type 'MaxHistoryTrackerFeaturizer' is not JSON serializable``
  when running ``rasa train core``

  using the ``RasaChat`` input channel.

[1.3.5] - 2019-09-20
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bugfixes
--------
- Fixed issue where ``rasa init`` would fail without spaCy being installed

[1.3.4] - 2019-09-20
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Features
--------
- Added the ability to set the ``backlog`` parameter in Sanics ``run()`` method using
  the ``SANIC_BACKLOG`` environment variable. This parameter sets the
  number of unaccepted connections the server allows before refusing new
  connections. A default value of 100 is used if the variable is not set.
- Status endpoint (``/status``) now also returns the number of training processes currently running

Bugfixes
--------
- Added the ability to properly deal with spaCy ``Doc``-objects created on
  empty strings as discussed `here <https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/issues/4445>`_.
  Only training samples that actually bear content are sent to ``self.nlp.pipe``
  for every given attribute. Non-content-bearing samples are converted to empty
  ``Doc``-objects. The resulting lists are merged with their preserved order and
  properly returned.
- asyncio warnings are now only printed if the callback takes more than 100ms
  (up from 1ms).
- ``agent.load_model_from_server`` no longer affects logging.

Improvements
------------
- The endpoint ``POST /model/train`` no longer supports specifying an output directory
  for the trained model using the field ``out``. Instead you can choose whether you
  want to save the trained model in the default model directory (``models``)
  (default behavior) or in a temporary directory by specifying the
  ``save_to_default_model_directory`` field in the training request.

[1.3.3] - 2019-09-13
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bugfixes
--------
- Added a check to avoid training ``CountVectorizer`` for a particular
  attribute of a message if no text is provided for that attribute across
  the training data.
- Default one-hot representation for label featurization inside ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier`` if label features don't exist.
- Policy ensemble no longer incorrectly wrings "missing mapping policy" when
  mapping policy is present.
- "text" from ``utter_custom_json`` now correctly saved to tracker when using telegram channel

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
- Removed computation of ``intent_spacy_doc``. As a result, none of the spacy components process intents now.

[1.3.2] - 2019-09-10
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bugfixes
--------
- SQL tracker events are retrieved ordered by timestamps. This fixes interactive
  learning events being shown in the wrong order.

  sub bots. Please see the
  `docs <https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/api/training-data-importers/>`_ for more
  information.
- throw error during training when triggers are defined in the domain without
  ``MappingPolicy`` being present in the policy ensemble
- The tracker is now available within the interpreter's ``parse`` method, giving the
  ability to create interpreter classes that use the tracker state (eg. slot values)
  during the parsing of the message. More details on motivation of this change see
  issues/3015.
- add example bot ``knowledgebasebot`` to showcase the usage of ``ActionQueryKnowledgeBase``
- ``softmax`` starspace loss for both ``EmbeddingPolicy`` and ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier``
- ``balanced`` batching strategy for both ``EmbeddingPolicy`` and ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier``
- ``max_history`` parameter for ``EmbeddingPolicy``

- New NLU component ``ResponseSelector`` added for the task of response selection
- Message data attribute can contain two more keys - ``response_key``, ``response`` depending on the training data
- New action type implemented by ``ActionRetrieveResponse`` class and identified with ``response_`` prefix
- Vocabulary sharing inside ``CountVectorsFeaturizer`` with ``use_shared_vocab`` flag. If set to True, vocabulary of corpus is shared between text, intent and response attributes of message
- Added an option to share the hidden layer weights of text input and label input inside ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier`` using the flag ``share_hidden_layers``
- New type of training data file in NLU which stores response phrases for response selection task.
- Add flag ``intent_split_symbol`` and ``intent_tokenization_flag`` to all ``WhitespaceTokenizer``, ``JiebaTokenizer`` and ``SpacyTokenizer``

- argument ``--config-endpoint`` to specify the URL from which ``rasa x`` pulls
  the runtime configuration (endpoints and credentials)
- ``LockStore`` class storing instances of ``TicketLock`` for every ``conversation_id``
- environment variables ``SQL_POOL_SIZE`` (default: 50) and ``SQL_MAX_OVERFLOW``

  ``SQLTrackerStore`` when used with the ``postgresql`` dialect
- Add a `bot_challenge` intent and a `utter_iamabot` action to all example projects and the rasa init bot.
- Allow sending attachments when using the socketio channel
- ``rasa data validate`` will fail with a non-zero exit code if validation fails

Improvements
------------
- added character-level ``CountVectorsFeaturizer`` with empirically found parameters
  into the ``supervised_embeddings`` NLU pipeline template
- NLU evaluations now also stores its output in the output directory like the core evaluation
- show warning in case a default path is used instead of a provided, invalid path
- compare mode of ``rasa train core`` allows the whole core config comparison,
  naming style of models trained for comparison is changed (this is a breaking change)
- pika keeps a single connection open, instead of open and closing on each incoming event
- ``RasaChatInput`` fetches the public key from the Rasa X API. The key is used to
  decode the bearer token containing the conversation ID. This requires
  ``rasa-x>=0.20.2``.
- more specific exception message when loading custom components depending on whether component's path or
  class name is invalid or can't be found in the global namespace
- change priorities so that the ``MemoizationPolicy`` has higher priority than the ``MappingPolicy``

- defaults parameters and architectures for both ``EmbeddingPolicy`` and
  ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier`` are changed (this is a breaking change)
- evaluation of NER does not include 'no-entity' anymore
- ``--successes`` for ``rasa test nlu`` is now boolean values. If set incorrect/successful predictions
  are saved in a file.
- ``--errors`` is renamed to ``--no-errors`` and is now a boolean value. By default incorrect predictions are saved
  in a file. If ``--no-errors`` is set predictions are not written to a file.
- Remove ``label_tokenization_flag`` and ``label_split_symbol`` from ``EmbeddingIntentClassifier``. Instead move these parameters to ``Tokenizers``.
- Process features of all attributes of a message, i.e. - text, intent and response inside the respective component itself. For e.g. - intent of a message is now tokenized inside the tokenizer itself.
- Deprecate ``as_markdown`` and ``as_json`` in favour of ``nlu_as_markdown`` and ``nlu_as_json`` respectively.
- pin python-engineio >= 3.9.3
- update python-socketio req to >= 4.3.1

- added option to specify custom button type for Facebook buttons
- added tracker store persisting trackers into a SQL database
  (``SQLTrackerStore``)

- Rasa  HTTP training endpoint at ``POST /jobs``. This endpoint
  will train a combined Rasa Core and NLU model
- ``ReminderCancelled(action_name)`` event to cancel given action_name reminder
  for current user
- Rasa HTTP intent evaluation endpoint at ``POST /intentEvaluation``.
  This endpoints performs an intent evaluation of a Rasa model
- option to create template for new utterance action in ``interactive learning``
- you can now choose actions previously created in the same session
  in ``interactive learning``
- add formatter 'black'
- channel-specific utterances via the ``- "channel":`` key in utterance templates
- arbitrary json messages via the ``- "custom":`` key in utterance templates and
  via ``utter_custom_json()`` method in custom actions
- support to load sub skills (domain, stories, nlu data)
- support to select which sub skills to load through ``import`` section in
  ``config.yml``
- support for spaCy 2.1
- a model for an agent can now also be loaded from a remote storage
- log level can be set via environment variable ``LOG_LEVEL``
- add ``--store-uncompressed`` to train command to not compress Rasa model
- log level of libraries, such as tensorflow, can be set via environment variable ``LOG_LEVEL_LIBRARIES``
- if no spaCy model is linked upon building a spaCy pipeline, an appropriate error message
  is now raised with instructions for linking one

Improvements
------------
- renamed all CLI parameters containing any ``_`` to use dashes ``-`` instead (GNU standard)
- renamed ``rasa_core`` package to ``rasa.core``
- for interactive learning only include manually annotated and ner_crf entities in nlu export
- made ``message_id`` an additional argument to ``interpreter.parse``
- changed removing punctuation logic in ``WhitespaceTokenizer``
- ``training_processes`` in the Rasa NLU data router have been renamed to ``worker_processes``
- created a common utils package ``rasa.utils`` for nlu and core, common methods like ``read_yaml`` moved there
- removed ``--num_threads`` from run command (server will be asynchronous but
  running in a single thread)
- the ``_check_token()`` method in ``RasaChat`` now authenticates against ``/auth/verify`` instead of ``/user``
- removed ``--pre_load`` from run command (Rasa NLU server will just have a maximum of one model and that model will be
  loaded by default)
- changed file format of a stored trained model from the Rasa NLU server to ``tar.gz``
- train command uses fallback config if an invalid config is given
- test command now compares multiple models if a list of model files is provided for the argument ``--model``
- Merged rasa.core and rasa.nlu server into a single server. See swagger file in ``docs/_static/spec/server.yaml`` for
  available endpoints.
- ``utter_custom_message()`` method in rasa_core_sdk has been renamed to ``utter_elements()``
- updated dependencies. as part of this, models for spacy need to be reinstalled
  for 2.1 (from 2.0)
- make sure all command line arguments for ``rasa test`` and ``rasa interactive`` are actually used, removed arguments
  that were not used at all (e.g. ``--core`` for ``rasa test``)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
- removed possibility to execute ``python -m rasa_core.train`` etc. (e.g. scripts in ``rasa.core`` and ``rasa.nlu``).
  Use the CLI for rasa instead, e.g. ``rasa train core``.
- removed ``_sklearn_numpy_warning_fix`` from the ``SklearnIntentClassifier``
- removed ``Dispatcher`` class from core
- removed projects: the Rasa NLU server now has a maximum of one model at a time loaded.

Bugfixes
--------
- evaluating core stories with two stage fallback gave an error, trying to handle None for a policy
- the ``/evaluate`` route for the Rasa NLU server now runs evaluation
  in a parallel process, which prevents the currently loaded model unloading
- added missing implementation of the ``keys()`` function for the Redis Tracker
  Store
- in interactive learning: only updates entity values if user changes annotation
- log options from the command line interface are applied (they overwrite the environment variable)
- all message arguments (kwargs in dispatcher.utter methods, as well as template args) are now sent through to output channels
- utterance templates defined in actions are checked for existence upon training a new agent, and a warning
  is thrown before training if one is missing
